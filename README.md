# TechNet Systems Cybersecurity Lab: Investigating and Securing Systems
(Ficticious Organization)

<h2> Lab </h2>

In this lab, I tackled key cybersecurity tasks to address a simulated system breach:<br />

-  <b>Process Monitoring</b>: Investigated active processes to identify unauthorized or malicious activity.<br />
-  <b>Password Auditing</b>: Used John the Ripper to assess user password strength and uncover vulnerabilities.<br />
-  <b>Access Control</b>: Secured system access by revoking unauthorized sudo privileges.<br />
-  <b>User and Group Cleanup</b>: Audited and updated user/group configurations to ensure proper access controls.<br />
-  <b>File Security</b>: Hardened critical system file permissions to prevent unauthorized access.<br />
-  <b>Legacy Service Removal</b>: Identified and removed insecure services (FTP, Telnet, etc.) to eliminate vulnerabilities.<br />


<h2> Step 1: Inventory of Active System Processes </h2>
I first executed a script file to compromise the system. Then, I ran the <b>top</b> command to generate a comprehensive list of all active processes. I carefully analyzed this list to identify any processes that appeared unfamiliar or suspicious. By comparing them against known safe processes and reviewing resource usage, I pinpointed potential anomalies that required further investigation or immediate action.

<h2> Step 2: Copying the Shadow Password File </h2>
I carefully copied the /etc/shadow file using secure file management commands such as <b>cp</b>, ensuring that appropriate permissions were maintained to prevent exposure of sensitive data. With the necessary root or administrative privileges, I accessed and copied the file securely. After executing the command, I verified the fileâ€™s integrity and confirmed its successful transfer to a secure location for further analysis. <br />

<h2> Step 3: Editing the Shadow Copy File to Retain Only System Users </h2>
I edited the shadow_copy file using the <b>nano</b> text editor, carefully reviewing each line to identify and remove any unnecessary or irrelevant entries that did not pertain to actual system users. I ensured that only legitimate system users remained, eliminating any obsolete accounts or test entries to maintain accuracy and security. <br />

<h2> Step 4: Running the Shadow File Through a Password Cracker </h2>
I used the <b>john</b> program to crack the passwords stored in the shadow_copy file. By leveraging a suitable wordlist and optimized cracking techniques, I systematically attempted to reveal user credentials. Once the process was complete, I reviewed the results to identify any successfully cracked passwords for further analysis. <br />

<h2> Step 5: Checking Sudo Access of Users with Weak Passwords </h2>
I used the <b>sudo -lU</b> command to check which users had sudo privileges. By cross-referencing this information with previously cracked passwords, I identified accounts with weak credentials that also had elevated access. These high-risk accounts were flagged for immediate action, and I documented my findings to support the revocation of their sudo privileges. <br />
<br />

<h2> Step 6: Removing Sudo Access from Users in the Sudoers File </h2>
I used <b>visudo</b> to securely edit the <b>/etc/sudoers</b> file, ensuring that any modifications would not introduce syntax errors. I carefully searched for user-specific entries granting sudo access and removed or commented out those associated with weak passwords. After making the necessary changes, I saved and exited the file, then verified the updates to confirm that unauthorized users no longer had elevated privileges. <br />
<br />

<h2> Step 7: Removing Less Access from Users in the Sudoers File </h2>
I used the <b>visudo</b> command to securely edit the <b>/etc/sudoers</b> file, ensuring that any modifications were syntax-checked to prevent misconfigurations. I carefully reviewed the file for user-specific or group-specific entries that granted unnecessary or unauthorized access. Identifying such entries, I either commented them out or removed them entirely to restrict unauthorized privilege escalation. After making the changes, I verified the updates to confirm that only authorized users retained appropriate sudo access. <br />
<br />

<h2> Step 8: Confirming Changes to the Sudoers File </h2>
After editing the <b>/etc/sudoers</b> file, I ran a syntax check using the <b>visudo</b> command to ensure that no errors were introduced, preventing potential misconfigurations that could lock out administrative access. I then manually reviewed the file to verify that only authorized users retained the necessary privileges. Finally, I confirmed the applied changes by checking user privileges with <b>sudo -l</b> for relevant accounts, ensuring that unauthorized access had been successfully revoked. <br />

<h2> Step 9: Checking IDs for Every User on the System </h2>
I ran the <b>id 'user'</b> command to retrieve detailed user information, including UID (User ID) and GID (Group ID). By systematically reviewing each entry, I ensured that administrative accounts had the correct assignments and that no unauthorized users possessed elevated privileges. Any discrepancies were flagged for further investigation and corrective action. <br />

<h2> Step 10: Checking Groups Users Belong to on the System </h2>
I ran the <b>groups</b> command for individual users to review all group memberships on the system. This allowed me to cross-check the groups each user belonged to and identify any unauthorized or suspicious group assignments. I paid special attention to privileged groups such as sudo or admin to ensure that only authorized accounts were included. <br />

<h2> Step 11: Removing Jack from the Sudo Group </h2>
I used the <b>usermod -G</b> command to remove Jack from the sudo group. After executing the command, I verified the change by running <b>groups jack</b> to confirm that Jack was no longer a member of the sudo group. <br />
<br />

<h2> Step 12: Removing Unauthorized Users and Groups from the System </h2>
I used the <b>deluser</b> and <b>delgroup</b> commands to remove unauthorized users and groups, ensuring that their associated files were also deleted to maintain system integrity. <br />
<br />

<h2> Step 13: Adding Users to the Appropriate Group </h2>
I created any missing groups using the <b>addgroup</b> command. Then, I used the <b>usermod</b> command to add users to their designated groups. Specifically, I ensured that users like Adam, Billy, Sally, and Max were members of the developers group and their own primary groups only. <br />
<br />

<h2> Step 14: Setting File Permissions </h2>
Guided by best practices, I adjusted file permissions for key system files to enhance their security using the <b>chmod</b> command. After applying these changes, I ran <b>ls -l</b> to verify the updated permissions and documented the adjustments for future reference.<br />
<br />

<h2> Step 15: Checking for Vulnerabilities </h2>
I used vulnerability assessment tools, including <b>systemctl</b>, to scan the system for misconfigurations, outdated software, and potential security gaps. After completing the scans, I reviewed the output for any identified vulnerabilities or warnings. <br />
<br />

<h2> Step 16: Stopping Vulnerable Services </h2>
After identifying vulnerable or unnecessary services during the audit, I took immediate steps to stop them. Using the <b>systemctl stop</b> command, I halted any flagged services. <br />
<br />

<h2> Step 17: Disabling Vulnerable Services </h2>
After stopping the flagged services, I disabled them to ensure they remained inactive. This was accomplished using the <b>systemctl disable</b> command. <br />
<br />

<h2> Step 18: Removing Vulnerable Services from the System </h2>
After stopping and disabling the flagged services, I uninstalled them using the package management tools available on the system. This ensured that any unnecessary or vulnerable software was completely removed from the system. <br />
